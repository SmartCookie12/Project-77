                Visual Studio Code is an offline html/css/js code platform where
                talented people can create amazing web applications. You can set
                it up by downloading it on your PC and adding html/css/js files.

                The Console Screen is a text-based interface that allows you
                to communicate with the computer's operating system or simply run
                code. We can open the console by right clicking on the website
                screen and selecting inspect. A small screen would pop up, and we'd
                have to the console tab. We can print anything in it by using the code
                "console.log".

           var last_name = "Vivekanand";
           console.log(last_name);

           var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name);
           console.log(full_name);

           var a = 20;
           console.log("Numbers");
           console.log(a);
           var b = 10;
           console.log(b);

           var add = a+b;
           console.log("Addition");
           console.log(add);

           var subtract = a-b;
           console.log("Subtraction");
           console.log(subtract);

           var divide = a/b;
           console.log("Division");
           console.log(divide);

           console.log("Multiplication");
